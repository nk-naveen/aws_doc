How do we make resource group execution conditional ? 

Writing condition for resource by using intrinsic function, such as "Fn::Equals". The resource group will only be executed if the specified condition is met.

Example:

	Resources:
	  MyBucket:
	    Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
	    Properties:
	      BucketName: my-bucket
	    Condition: CreateBucket
	 
	Conditions:
	  CreateBucket: !Equals [!Ref EnvType, "prod"]

Bucket will be created if the value of the parameter "EnvType" is equal to "prod". If the value is not "prod", the resource group will not be created.
