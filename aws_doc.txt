IAM

Step 1: created a user dg_intern_naveen.
Step 2: created a group s3_access_group with administrator permissions.
Step 3: added dg_intern_naveen user to s3_access_group.
Step 4: created a policy s3_read_access with s3 read access permissions.
Step 5: Attached the s3_read_access policy to the group s3_access_group.

2.Create a role which has read access to ec2 resources. Using aws cli assume the role and list out the ec2 instances
Step 1: created a role ec2_rescource_read_access which has read access to ec2 resource
Step 2: Using aws cli assume the role and list out the ec2 instances
	- Aws configuration:
	    >> aws configure
	- Listing Instances:
	    >> aws ec2 describe-instances
	- Ec2 instances:
	    >> aws ec2 describe-instances --output table --query 'Reservations[].Instances[].Tags[?Key==`Name`].Value'


3. Create an IAM role for account A which has access to EC2 and try to use that
IAM role in account B using STS, try to list running EC2 instances in account A in
AWS cli

Step 1: Create IAM role "ec2-read_access" in account A
		- select create role and choose aws account
		- click another account and give Account ID
		- attach "AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess" policy 
		- review and create

Step 2: Goto account B and Create IAM role "sts-assume_role" 
		- click on inline policy and enter following policy
			- 	{
			    "Version": "2012-10-17",
			    "Statement": {
			        "Effect": "Allow",
			        "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
			        "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::269764929305:role/ec2-read_access"
			    	}
				}	
		- Save 
		
Step 3 : Goto aws cli and create a session with assume role
		- aws sts assume-role --role-arn "arn:aws:iam::269764929305:role/ec2-read_access" --role-session-name "ec2-access"		
		- we ll get the output of temporary security credentials , copy these creds and set.
		  - set like this 
			  	$ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=ASIAXVB5JUJ6DHZSQM5K
				$ export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=7p/V4ZIAFM2Ia1G4/Kqus86a8vOHWHRaK97k7toc
				$ export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEHs...==		

		- now list the ec2 instances
			- aws ec2 describe-instances
